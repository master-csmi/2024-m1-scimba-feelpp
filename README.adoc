= Coupling ScimBa and Feel++

[[project-overview]]
== Project Overview

This project attempts the integration of https://sciml.gitlabpages.inria.fr/scimba/[ScimBa] and https://docs.feelpp.org/user/latest/index.html[Feelpp].
Our goal is to streamline data exchange and empower users to leverage the combined strengths of ScimBa and Feel++ effectively.

[[technologies]]
== Technologies

This project utilizes the following technologies:

* `ScimBa` : A Python library emphasizing machine learning. ScimBa is used in this project to apply machine learning techniques.
* `Feelpp` : A library known for its Galerkin methods in PDE solving. Feel++ is used to solve PDEs in this project.
* `Docker`: A platform used to containerize the application. Docker is used to build a reproducible environment for the project.
* `Python` : The primary programming language used in this project.
* `Git` : Version control system used for source code management.

Each of these technologies plays a crucial role in the development and operation of the project.

[[launch]]
== Launch

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

Open the project in Visual Studio Code:

[source,python]
----
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/master-csmi/2024-m1-scimba-feelpp.git

# Change branch
git checkout feelpp-solver

# To build a Docker image:
docker buildx build  -t feelpp_scimba:latest .


# Run the Docker container

docker run -it feelpp_scimba:latest


#VS Code will detect the .devcontainer configuration and prompt you to reopen the folder in a container.

=== Example
[source,python]
----
import os
import sys
import feelpp
import feelpp.toolboxes.core as tb
from tools.Poisson_feelpp import Poisson_feel

# mandatory things
sys.argv = ["feelpp_app"]
e = feelpp.Environment(sys.argv,
                       opts=tb.toolboxes_options("coefficient-form-pdes", "cfpdes"),
                       config=feelpp.localRepository('feelpp_cfpde'))

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Poisson problem
# - div (diff * grad (u)) = f    in Omega
#                     u   = g    in Gamma_D
# Omega = domain, either cube or ball
# Approx = lagrange Pk of order order
# mesh of size h

# Example usage of the Poisson class
# Create an instance of the Poisson class for a 2-dimensional problem
P = Poisson_feel(dim=2)

# Solve the Poisson problem with the specified parameters
P(h=0.05,                                         # mesh size 
    name='u',                                     # name of the variable u
    rhs='8*pi*pi*sin(2*pi*x)*sin(2*pi*y)',        # right hand side
    diff='{1,0,0,1}',                             # diffusion matrix
    g='0',                                        # Dirichlet boundary condition            
    geofile=None,                                 # domain geometry file          
    plot=None,                                    # plot the solution
    )
